Description: A resource-sharing web app designed to bridge the education gap for underprivileged children. The platform allows individuals to share educational materials, such as books, worksheets, videos, and tutorials, providing access to learning resources for children who lack them. Users can upload, organize, and share their content while children and their guardians can access these resources freely or at minimal cost. The goal is to foster education equity and empower communities through shared knowledge and collaboration.
