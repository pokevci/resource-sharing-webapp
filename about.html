      <h1>About DataHub</h1>
      <p>Welcome to <strong>DataHub</strong>, a community-driven data-sharing platform dedicated to supporting children in need of educational resources. Our mission is to bridge the gap between those who have access to materials and those who need them most. We believe every child deserves the opportunity to learn, grow, and reach their fullest potential—no matter their circumstances.</p>
      
      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>At DataHub, we connect donors with children in need by providing a simple platform where educational materials like textbooks, notes, online resources, and study guides can be donated. By sharing knowledge, we create a ripple effect that empowers young learners and opens doors to a brighter future.</p>

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>Donors can upload educational materials to our platform, where they will be carefully categorized and made available to children, parents, and educators who need them. Whether it’s a physical textbook or digital study materials, your contribution makes a real difference. We make sure that every donation is distributed to those who need it the most—ensuring that no child is left behind.</p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>We envision a world where education is accessible to all, regardless of financial or geographical barriers. Through the generosity of individuals, organizations, and educators, DataHub strives to make educational resources available to every child who wants to learn, making it easier for them to succeed in their studies and in life.</p>
